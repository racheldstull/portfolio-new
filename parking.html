                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>“IU Parking” is an application that assists IU & IUPUI students, faculty,
                        and staff find available parking on campus.</p>

                    <p> In this application, users can perform a few tasks all revolving around
                        finding available parking on campus. Users can review information about
                        a parking location, such as address, number of available spaces, permit
                        types, distance to location, and review available parking spaces. Users
                        can also inspect a map of campus with parking locations designated.
                        Users cannot save parking spaces, only see a preview of the latest
                        update on availability. </p>

            <div class="ux-persona-column ux-persona-column-text">
                <p>I chose to interview current students at IUPUI who commute to campus
                    (or commuted to campus in the recent past). The demographics came out
                    to be roughly the same from individual to individual: full-time student
                    with a job, young, female, white, single, has siblings, and has no
                    disabilities.</p>
                <p>Each interviewee is dedicated to school and takes it seriously. All
                    live off campus, but are within a reasonable distance to commute
                    everyday. All are capable when it comes to operating technology,
                    especially a mobile phone and a personal computer. They are generally
                    creative and adventurous, disliking dishonesty, tardiness,
                    close-mindedness, and bad user experiences.</p>
                <p>Finding parking on campus is an issue for interviewees. They all have
                    to make an effort to plan and arrive on campus early to be able to find
                    a place to park.</p>
                <p>Due to the COVID situation, I was unable to interview Employees at the
                    time of this research.</p>
